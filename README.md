## Project Overview

This repository is part of the course project from my Machine Learning module, where I implemented machine learning algorithms and explored various datasets. Each folder contains code, datasets, and documentation relevant to the respective projects.

## Folder Structure


Each folder includes Jupyter notebooks and any additional files such as datasets or results.

## Installation

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/SheemaMasood381/Machine-Learning.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   cd Machine-Learning

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Install the required packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
